To build an up-to-date Mumble build environment on OS X, do the following:

1.  Create a MumbleBuild directory in your home dir:

  $ mkdir -p ~/MumbleBuild

2.  Copy the 'env' script to the directory you created in step 1:

  $ cp env ~/MumbleBuild/env

3.  Source the env script to set up the proper environment variables for
    the Mumble build environment:

  $ source ~/MumbleBuild/env

4.  Build the enviroment:

  $ ./build-all.bash

This will fetch and build all libraries and tools needed to build Mumble
from scratch on OS X.  Enjoy!

NOTE: The above instructions expect you to be on a Mountion Lion machine with Xcode 4.4 installed.
NOTE: These scripts do not currently provide an autoconf binary for OS X systems that don't have one; install via homebrew for now.
